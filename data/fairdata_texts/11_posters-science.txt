Posters.science
Share posters, make discoveries
A free and open-source platform that makes scientific posters FAIR and AI-ready so they can be discovered, cited, and reused long after the conference ends.

Overview
Millions of scientific posters are presented every year, containing valuable early-stage ideas and insights, but most vanish quietly after a conference ends. Posters.science is a free and open-source platform that makes it easier for researchers to share and discover posters, turning them into enduring research assets.
What is Posters.science?
Posters.science enables researchers to share posters that are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and AI-ready, maximizing their reach and impact. It also helps users discover posters so their content can drive new discoveries, collaborations, hypotheses, and funding decisions.
How does it work?
Researchers can upload their posters and let AI-powered tools extract rich metadata, generate a machine-friendly version, and archive everything on trusted repositories like Zenodo. Users can then ask complex research questions via smart search and instantly find relevant posters from a growing registry of openly available content.
What challenges does it address?
Most posters disappear after a conference or are shared without standardized metadata, making them hard to search, cite, or reuse. Posters.science preserves and indexes posters, enriches them with structured metadata, and creates machine-friendly representations.
Why is this important?
Posters often contain first disclosures of research ideas, datasets, and methods. Making them FAIR and AI-ready ensures they can be discovered, connected, and reused to accelerate scientific progress.
Development approach
Posters.science is developed using an open-source approach, enabling transparency, reuse, and collaboration with the broader community of researchers, institutions, and tool builders.
