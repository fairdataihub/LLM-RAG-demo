Visualizing the Impact of SPARC
SPARClink aggregates and visualizes how SPARC datasets, maps, and models are reused across the scientific literature, making the program's broader impact visible and explorable.

Overview
SPARClink provides a system that queries all external publications using open source tools and platforms to create interactable visualizations that showcases the impact that SPARC has on the overall scientific research community.
What is SPARC?
The NIH's Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program accelerates development of therapies that modulate peripheral nerve activity to improve organ function.

FAIR SPARC Data Guidelines
SPARC-funded researchers curate datasets using the SPARC Data Standards (SDS) and share them openly on the Pennsieve data platform as part of their funding  agreement with SPARC

What does “Impact” mean here?
The SPARC program provides datasets, maps and computational studies that follow FAIR principles and is used by researchers all around the world. The usage of SPARC resouces by platforms and programs ouside SPARC is what we view as the meaning of the term 'Impact'.
What does SPARClink do?
SPARClink uses data from existing SPARC publications, datasets and protocols to create an interactive visualization that you can use to view the impact of SPARC.
Development Approach
SPARClink is an open-source project published under an MIT License. The tooling, data pipelines, and visualizations are designed to be inspectable, reusable, and extensible by the community.

Origin Story
SPARClink began as a concept at the 2021 NIH SPARC FAIR Codeathon: a way to visualize how SPARC publications and datasets are reused across the broader scientific landscape. The prototype placed third in the competition and has since evolved into a sustained open-source effort.
