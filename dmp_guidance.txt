NIH DMS Plan Required Elements:
A Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Plan should address:
(1) Data type and amount
(2) Related tools, software, and documentation
(3) Standards
(4) Repository selection
(5) Timing of sharing
(6) Access, distribution, or reuse considerations

Repository selection guidance:
Repository selection should be justified by data type and community norms.
The repository should support metadata, persistent identifiers, long-term preservation,
and (when needed) access controls for sensitive data.

Human participant data & controlled access:
For human participant data, sharing may require controlled access and safeguards.
Plans should describe de-identification steps, governance (e.g., Data Use Agreements),
and an access review/approval process.

Documentation & metadata:
Documentation should support reuse: README, data dictionary/codebook, variable definitions,
provenance notes, and metadata needed for discovery and interpretation.

Timing of sharing:
Timing should specify when data will be shared (e.g., at publication, end of project,
or rolling releases). Any embargo/delay should be justified by ethics or policy.

Derived data when raw data cannot be shared:
If raw patient-level data cannot be shared broadly, plans can share derived or aggregated outputs
(e.g., feature tables, summary statistics, model performance metrics) to maximize reuse while protecting privacy.
